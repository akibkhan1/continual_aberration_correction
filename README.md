PSF Data Description: The zip file contains MATLAB files, one for each lens and aperture setting. Each MATLAB file contains a cell-array C, the array has the size (N,4), N being the number of measured PSF-patches for the given lens/aperture combination. N is on the order of 4000. The 4 entries are: 1: x-position, 2: y-position, 3: index of the exposure time, 4: 111x111x3 RGB patch of a PSF. The x/y-positions are the the pixels of the Canon 5DSR sensor.

Run `get_blurred_dataset.py` to generate blurred dataset for a particular lens system.
